The proposed it as system able to autonomously take-off, hover, transition into fixed-wing mode, fly autonomously over a pattern, transition back into hover mode, and land autonomously.
The test performed so far involved only a take-off and hovering. these are two of the trickiest parts, however two crucial parts remain to be tested: Landing and transitioning, specially automatically.

This test had promising results, indicating that it's very much possible to have such an aircraft, but more tests are required to verify the remaining aspects.

The results, as they are, are deemed satisfactory.
