The assessment was incremental. First, the aerodynamic properties were tested on a manual flight, qualitativaly, regarding properties such as stall angle, stall speed, and equilibrium point in flight. Following this, the hover capabilities were tested, such as altitude and atitude control. With the basic flight capabilities proven, a few autonomous, test flights were performed, without VTOL. Finally, it's VTOL capabilities were benchmarked. These tests are better described, as well as their results, in the following sections.
