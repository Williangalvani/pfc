\section{Brief Introduction to Flight Mechanics}

Flight mechanics deal with a vehicles interaction with propulsional, aerodynamic, and gravitational forces.

In order to achieve proper flight, a vehicle needs an upwards force, and means of maneuverability. 


\section{Fixed-Wing Mechanics}

In fixed-wing aircrafts, the force responsible for cancelling the gravitational pull and keeping the vehicle aloft is the lift generated in the wings.

In a simplified explanation, two main principles are responsible for generating lift:

\subsection{Flow deflection and Newton's laws}

Most wings have an angle of attack (to be hereafter called $\alpha$ ) such that $\alpha > 0$, which means the air passin through it gets deflected down. According to Newton's second law, an opposite force is necessary on the wing. This force is the generated lift.

\subsection{Increased flow speed and Bernoulli's principle}

Bernoulli's principle states that within a steady airflow of constant energy, when the air flows through a region of lower pressure it speeds up and vice versa. Implying there is a direct mathematical relationship between the pressure and the speed, meaning if one knows the speed at all points within the airflow, on can calculate the pressure and vice versa. For a cambered airfoil (where the chord at the top is longer that the chord at the bottom) the/home/will/Pictures/Screenshot from 2017-11-13 11-03-27.png air needs to take a longer path, moving faster, thus lowering the pressure on the top, and generating lift.


\subsection{Airfoil Shape}
How much lift is generated depends on the chosen airfoil.
%
An cambered airfoil (longer chord on the upper surface than in the lower one) generated lift even when the angle of attack $\alpha$ is zero.
Simmetric airfoils need a positive angle, and the lift is generated by deflecting the air downwards.
Other properties that depend on the airfoil shape are the drag (air force pushing agains the direction of movement) and angular moment it generates on the aircraft. 

\subsection{The Coordinate System and Nomenclature}

The coordinate system, when dealing with the fixed-wing mode, is as shown in figure \ref{fig:coords1}

Where:


\begin{itemize}

\item $x$, $y$, and $z$ are the coordinates, with the origin in the vehicle's center of mass.
\item $u$, $v$, and $w$ are the linear velocities in each of the $x$, $y$, and $z$ coordinates, respectively.
\item $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are the components of the aerodynamic force in each of the $x$, $y$, and $z$ coordinates, respectively.
\item $p$, $q$, and $r$ are the linear velocities in each of the $x$, $y$, and $z$ coordinates, respectively.
\item $u$, $v$, and $w$ are the linear velocities in each of the $x$, $y$, and $z$ coordinates, respectively.
\item  Although not indicated in the figure, the variables $\phi$, $\theta$, $\psi$ represent the angular rotations,
relative to the equilibrium state, about the x, y, and z axes, respectively. Thus, $p=\dot{\phi}$, $q = \dot{theta}$
and $r = \dot{\psi}$ where the dots represent time derivatives.

$\phi$, $\theta$, and $\psi$ can also be referred, respectively, as \textit{yaw}, \textit{pitch}, and \textit{roll}.
