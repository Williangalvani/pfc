\chapter{The Requisites} \label{chap:3}


\section{Objective}
%
The final objective of the work is to have a working prototype of a VTOL fixed-wing UAV able to autonomously take off vertically, transition into fixed-wing mode, follow a planned path taking pictures, transition into hover mode, and land autonomously.
%
It's expected that the prototype fulfills the hole between rotating-wing and fixed-wing aircraft by being able to land in tight spaces, but having a perfomance close to that of fixed-wing aircrafts.

\section{Requisites}

For the design, a few conditions have been imposed by the available material and desired performance:

\begin{itemize}

\item The flight time should be between 1 and 2 hours.
\item The cruise speed must be around $15 m/s$.
\item The batteries used will be 6s lithium-polymer packs of XXXXX  \todo{capacidade}mAh.
\item The motors should preferably be the ones already in use at the company, MK3538, Mk3638, or MK3644
\item The UAV must be able to take of and land autonomously.

\end{itemize}
