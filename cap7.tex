\chapter{Prototyping}
As in any product development, a few protoypes were developed.
First a smaller , 50cm wingspan aircraft with no airfoil was assembled to test and tune the flight controllers. The reduced version also enabled testing in close spaces and proximity with people with reduced danger.

With the reduced prototype proven, the larger one, photography-ready was developed. The larger one is closer to the final desired product, and is able to be used as such.

Both prototypes are described, as well as their assemblies, in the next sections.
 


\section{Reduced Scale Prototype}

A reduced prototype was used for preliminary tests of the flight controller and control systems.

Mechanically, this prototype consists of a foam board, two motors, and two control surfaces.

Smaller electronics are used as well. The servos are Turnigy 9 gram servos, The motors are AXN Floater-Jet 2208 2150KV brushless motors, the Escs are HobbyKing's RedBrick 30A ESCs, and the battery a Zippy Compact 3s 1000mah 35C.

The control surfaces were taped to the main body, and linked to the servos by a wire and plastic horn.

The motors had a custom mount 3D-Printed and fitted into the foam.

For the tests and tuning, the prototype had a hook on top, so it could be hang on the ceiling to avoid hitting the floor and walls during the tests.
