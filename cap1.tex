\section{Novarum Sky}
Novarum Sky is a still young company, based in Florian√≥polis-Brazil, which develops drone-related technologies, including long-range digital audio and video transmission, and realtime kinematics for precise localization during inspections and mapping.

\section{Motivation}
Technology and auomation have been changing and improving a lot of tasks on last few decades.
%
One of the tasks is aerial mapping, which started with balloons, then manned airplanes, and now, for smaller areas, is done mostly with drones\todo{citation needed, improvent needed}

\section{Objectives}

%
The final objective of the work is to have a working prototype of a VTOL fixed-wing UAV able to autonomously take off vertically, transition into fixed-wing mode, follow a planned path taking pictures, transition into hover mode, and land autonomously.
%
It's planned to have a smaller prototype to test and tune the hover mode before testing the larger, heavier and more powerful final prototype, for safety and practicity reasons.
%
The possible on-board electronics will be briefly described and one of them chosen.
%
An overview will be given of the control systems in place and their tuning.
%
The requisites for the job will be gathered, and the eletro-mechanical structure designed and built around it.
%
It's expected that the prototype fulfills the hole between rotating-wing and fixed-wing aircraft by being able to land in tight spaces, but having a perfomance close to that of fixed-wing aircrafts.
